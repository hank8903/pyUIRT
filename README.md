I originally wanted to be able to use my USB-UIRT with my home automation system after I had switched to a mac. There wasn't much mac support and I didnt want to use the FTDI driver, so I wanted to see if I could create a USB-UIRT plugin to work with Indigo Home Automation software on the mac. First though I needed to get the basic communication functionality working. The project is a mess right now just a whole collection of files where I was trying different things. Hopefully somebody with more expertise than I can make sense of it all and bring this project to completion.
